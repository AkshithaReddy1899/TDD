# TDD
## Test-driven development

The idea behind test-driven development (TDD) is that tests are not an afterthought. Also, it makes you think about how your code behaves before starting to code.

Why is TDD important?

Because it will allow you to iterate over your solution faster and more efficiently. Doing TDD makes you write tests first, which is mostly overlooked and sometimes completely ignored, and then write the actual implementation.

This way of working will allow faster development because if a requirement changes and you implement the change everything else is working as expected thanks to having tests for everything else.
